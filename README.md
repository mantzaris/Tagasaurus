# Tagasaurus
Tag Your Planet


## Overview  
Tagasaurus is an **offline-first desktop app** that keeps your photos, PDFs, videos, GIFs, and audio **local on your own disk**. Local machine-learning lets you locate files simply, or drop in a face and find every shot of that person instantly.


## Key Features  
- **ML-powered visual search** - match a face by example (webcam, screen-share, or any image).  
- **Natural text queries** - 'sunset beach 2022' pulls the similar memories you want.  
- **Import / export** - save, share, or migrate your entire library as a single archive. Simply drag and drop images onto the app to store them. Import data later to merge the storage.
- **Cross-platform** - binaries for both **Linux** and **Windows**; no cloud, no sign-ups.
- **People-network** - navigate the people from your photos using an intuitive point and click tool.
